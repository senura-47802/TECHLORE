        <h2>History of PC gaming</h2>
          <p>What a huge experience. From my experience as a Game player and a Programmer. this is a technology that wants to combine many ICT fields. (3D modelling & designing | graphic designing | programming ,etc…) only those are the things we want to make a successful game! we want socialized people because without that we can gameplayer the same without those! for a game players, want to know about what are the specifications that we want to play each game! Playing games not only has disadvantages!...</p>

          <p>Quantum calculating is a type of calculation whose movements can harness the wonders of branch of quantum physics, in the way that superposition, impedance, and predicament. Devices that act quantity computations are popular as quantity calculatings. Though current quantity calculatings are excessively limited to beat typical (classic) calculatings for efficient uses, best realizations are trusted expected fit resolving sure computational questions, in the way that number factorization (that underlies RSA encryption), materially faster than chaste calculatings. The study of quantity estimating is a subfield of quantity informatics....</p>

This section will sketch some of the highlights as background information for what follows. For a complete record of Cryptography, Kahn’s (1995) book is recommended reading. For a comprehensive treatment of the current state-of-the-art security and Cryptographic algorithms, protocols and application, see Kaufman et AI 2002). For a more mathematical approach, see (Stinson, 2002). For a less mathematical approach, see (Burnett and Paine 2000)....</p>

        <h2>What is NFT?</h2>
          <p>Perhaps the most famous use case for NFTs is that of cryptokitties. Launched in November 2017, cryptokitties are digital representations of cats with unique identifications on Ethereum’s blockchain. Each kitty is unique and has a price in ether. They reproduce among themselves and produce new offspring, which have different attributes and valuations compared to their parents. Within a few short weeks of their launch, cryptokitties racked up a fan base that spent $20 million worth of ether to purchase, feed, and nurture them. Some enthusiasts even spent upward of $100,000 on the effort...</p>

          <p>Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture and operation of robots. The objective of the robotics field is to create intelligent machines that can assist humans in a variety of ways. Robotics can take on a number of forms. A robot may resemble a human, or it may be in the form of a robotic application, such as robotic process automation (RPA), which simulates how humans engage with software to perform repetitive, rules-based tasks. While the field of robotics and exploration of the potential uses and functionality of robots have grown substantially in the 20th century...</p>
